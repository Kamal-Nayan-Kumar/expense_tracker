# ðŸ¤– AI Expense Tracker Telegram Bot

This project provides a seamless way to track personal expenses via Telegram. It uses the multimodal power of **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for highly accurate data extraction and a **Vercel** serverless backend with **Appwrite** for persistence.

## âœ¨ Key Features

* **Intelligent Logging:** Upload a **photo of a receipt** or type the expense in **natural language**.
* **AI Extraction:** Gemini extracts `Category`, `Description`, and `Amount` and converts it to a clean JSON object.
* **Structured Storage:** Data is saved to your self-hosted or cloud **Appwrite** database.
* **Real-time Reports:** Use slash commands to instantly summarize spending totals by day, week, or month.
* **Stack:** Python/FastAPI backend on Vercel.

### 3. Project Structure & Dependencies

Your repository must follow this structure for Vercel deployment:

```
/project-root
â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.py      \# FastAPI application (main logic)
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€â”€ vercel.json
```


**`requirements.txt`**

```
fastapi
uvicorn
appwrite
google-genai
requests
pydantic
````

**`vercel.json`**
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "api/index.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "api/index.py"
    }
  ]
}
````

### 4\. Vercel Deployment

1.  **Environment Variables:** Go to your Vercel Project Settings and add the following Environment Variables. These must match the keys in your Python code:

      * `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
      * `GEMINI_API_KEY`
      * `APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`
      * `APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`
      * `APPWRITE_API_KEY`
      * `APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID`
      * `APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID`

2.  **Deploy:** Deploy your project via the Vercel website dashboard by linking your Git repository.

### 5\. Set the Telegram Webhook

Once the Vercel deployment is live (e.g., at `https://your-app.vercel.app/`), run this **single command** in your terminal (replace placeholders with your actual values):

```bash
curl -F "url=https://<YOUR_VERCEL_URL>" "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook"
```

A success response (`"ok":true`) confirms Telegram is routing messages to your Vercel backend.
